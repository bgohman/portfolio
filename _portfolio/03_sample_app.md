## Overview

While going through the BLOC curriculum for the Rails web development apprenticeship, I often found myself wanting to understand more about how certain pieces work.  After learning about using Devise for user authentication, my mentor suggested the Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl.  This project is the result of my reading and following of that tutorial.

## What I learned

The Rails tutorial is very well written and very thorough.  During the course of my apprenticeship, I completed the tutorial and the sample app project twice with about two months in between.  On my first time through, I was able to follow along and grasp most of the concepts.  On my second time through, I was able to think more about how and why everything worked the way that it did.  I was also able to better understand the tests.  When I started the tutorial the first time, I knew what TDD and BDD were, but that was about all.  After completing it the second time, I have a much greater appreciation for how to get started with writing my own tests.  My number one goal as a developer is to get better at writing tests.
