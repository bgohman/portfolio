## Overview

I have always been interested in how people learn and how we develop our various talents.  I have been particularly impacted by these three popular books: *Mindset* by Carol Dweck, *Nurtured by Love* by Shinichi Suzuki, and *The Talent Code* by Daniel Coyle.  The common theme in these books is that every one of us has potential for greatness and that we achieve this greatness through gradual and sustained practice.  I built Smickle thinking about helping people become more effective with their music practice.

There is a lot to keep track of as a music student, and it is easy to get distracted from the most important concepts you should be working on.  Smickle organizes your daily practice and provides the structure needed to practice efficiently. It helps you stay on task and focus on what you really want to achieve.  If you have a large amount of practice tasks that get spread out over a number of days like scales or review pieces, Smickle can help make sure that you are getting to all of them.

By effectively dealing with the necessary details, you can have fun learning to play an instrument.

## Key Features

* Users can create practice tasks and add them to a student's daily practice routine.
* Users can add a short reminder and detailed instructions for each task.
* Users can create a 'task-jar' with any number of tasks and then assign a selected number of them.  You can choose to complete them in order, or have them shuffled and chosen randomly until all of the tasks are complete.  Then start over and complete them all again!
* Students can check a box to mark tasks as complete.
* A user can review their practice history on a calendar which shows which days you practiced, listened, had a lesson, or had a performance.
* A user can see fun statistics about their practicing like the total number of completed tasks, or their total practice time.
* A user can see the last time they practiced and also their current and longest streaks of consecutive days.
* There are two practice 'games'. A 100 times chart, where you can fill up a chart with fun stickers, and the 'plus 7 game', where you move up for a correct repetition and down for an incorrect repetition. There is a fun CSS animation of a penguin that moves up and down a staircase, and does a little dance when you win.
