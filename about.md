I am a problem solver.  I particularly enjoy finding or inventing clear, effecient and sustainable solutions.  I love learning about everything, and especially about things that help me improve at my craft.  I began my career as a public school music teacher and then had the amazing opportunity to work on software solutions for music students and teachers at MakeMusic.  I quickly discovered that this was a great fit for me.  After 10 years of performing various roles on software and content development teams, I am now fully immersed in the world of Ruby on Rails web development.  I am currently working on Smickle, a web-based practicing journal for music students and parents.

I live in Minnesota with my family.  Outside of work, I enjoy helping my children with their violin practicing, riding my bike, and dreaming about our next family trip.
